  <p>Hello, [name]! My name is Andrea Michelle. Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study, and I hope you find this experience enjoyable. I am conducting a usability test for the USA.gov website. I will give you a set of tasks a typical user would have when they are using this site, and I want you to try to complete these tasks to the best of your ability. I am interested in knowing how you do things, what you interact with, etc. Most importantly, I’m interested to know what you’re thinking when using the site, so I need you to “think out loud.”</p><br>
  <p>For example, if something on the site confuses you, you’d probably be thinking something like “why can’t I figure this out?” or “how come this isn’t working like I am expecting it to?” I want you to say it out loud. This helps me understand what you’re thinking while you are using the site. I won’t be able to know anything you won’t tell me, so please say whatever’s on your mind as you explore and use the site to complete the given tasks. There are no wrong answers. I want to know your honest opinion.</p><br>
  <p>I give you a number of tasks to complete. Each task will have a specific goal, and I want you to explore the website and figure out how to complete the tasks. Please use the website in a way that makes the most sense to you. After each one, if you could explain your experience with it, how you felt during the task, I’d appreciate it. Also, this study will be recorded for later use. Is that okay?</p><br>
  <p>So, before we get started with the tasks, do you have any questions or concerns?</p><br>
  <h5>Say and allow the user to complete the tasks...</h5><br><br>
  <p>Overall, how would you describe your experience using USA.gov, including how easy or difficult it was to find what you needed, how satisfied you felt with the site, and how well it met your expectations; were there any parts of the site you especially liked, such as navigation, content, or visual design; anything you found frustrating or confusing, like unclear labels, too much information, or difficulty knowing where to click; and if you could change just one thing about the site to improve your experience or make it easier to use, what would that be?</p><br>
  <p>And that’s it! Thank you for participating in this study! I hope you enjoyed it, and have a great rest of your day!</p><br>
  <p>Do you have any questions for me before we end?</p>
