  <h2>What did you see?</h2>
  <p>The usability testing videos and a heuristic evaluation of USA.gov showed some interface flaws. For example, cluttered homepage layouts with dense text blocks, insufficient link contrast, inconsistent heading lengths and external link indicators, multi-level navigation requiring user recall, and disorientation from the site designs. The participants showed hesitation when deciding which links to click when finding specific information.</p><br>
  <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
  <p>These findings do not adhere to Nielsen heuristics, including aesthetic and minimalist design, recognition rather than recall, and error prevention. These make it harder for novice and disabled users to use and navigate the site, increasing the chance of task abandonment. However, most of the site is usable for some users.</p><br>
  <h2>What should we do about it?</h2>
  <p>USA.gov should focus on fixing the main problems first: making links darker for better contrast, adding icons for outside links, shortening headings to match, and adding quick buttons for popular tasks like "Renew Passport." In addition, USA.gov should aim to fully comply with U.S. Web Design System's requirements.</p><br><br>
  <h2>Supporting evidence from user videos:</h2>
  <ul>Jonah  struggled with the cluttered homepage starting at <a href="https://youtu.be/v4-VtIxR3EE?t=80s" target="_blank">1:20</a> in the video https://youtu.be/v4-VtIxR3EE. Users could easily become frustrated by this and leave the site.</ul><br>
  <ul>Felix noted unclear external links leading to pages that display clusters of text while browsing topics from <a href="https://youtu.be/_qxRkNW9M9c?t=90s" target="_blank">1:30-3:00</a> in https://youtu.be/_qxRkNW9M9c. According to Felix, users can reach the correct page easily, but may not want to read a page that is text and links, making it less useful.</ul><br>
  <ul>Noah User struggled from the cluttered homepage and broad navigation categories and deep searching needs starting at around <a href="https://youtu.be/Kunx95VKmuI?t=132s" target="_blank">2:12</a> in https://youtu.be/Kunx95VKmuI, not meeting heuristic principal number 7 and 6.</ul>

  <h2>Top Findings</h2>
  <p>The heuristic evaluation of USA.gov found seven usability problems based on Nielsen's design principles. These problems affect how clearly users can see and understand the information, how easily they can navigate the site, and how accessible it is to all users. The issues are from cluttered page layouts, inconsistent styles and headings, poor color contrast that can make some links hard to see for colourblind people, and links that are not clearly marked as internal or external. The videos show that these problems can cause users to hesitate and possibly become frustrated, particularly when they have to search too much or distinguish links.</p><br>
  <h2>Severity Codes</h2>
  <p>The severity of these issues has been categorized into four levels: cosmetic problems (only affecting appearance slightly), minor problems (having a small impact on usability), major problems (causing significant difficulties and should be fixed quickly), and critical problems (making the site very difficult or impossible to use). In addition to the original severity, the ratings also note how often the problem occurs, how much it affects users, and whether it stays a problem throughout the site. Some major problems, such as poor navigation that relies on memory and clarifying what is under each category, need to be addressed to decrease user frustration or abandonment.</p><br><br>
